# Introduction

Welcome to the **Structura** documentation. Structura is a powerful interface designed for structured Large Language Model (LLM) generation.

### Core Mission
The goal of Structura is to eliminate the unpredictability of LLM outputs. By providing a suite of tools for defining strict schemas, templates, and regex constraints, Structura ensures that every response from your model fits perfectly into your application's logic.

### Key Features
- **Native Ollama Support**: Leverage the power of local LLMs with strictly constrained generation.
- **Artifact Library**: Save and manage your JSON schemas, templates, and regex patterns.
- **Real-time Validation**: GBNF-based validation ensures your output matches your requirements at the token level.
- **Flexible Backends**: Switch between local (Ollama, vLLM) and cloud (OpenAI) providers seamlessly.
